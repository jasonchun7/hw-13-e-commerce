# Homework 13: E-commerce Back End

## Description

Internet retail, also known as e-commerce, is the largest sector of the electronics industry, generating an estimated $29 trillion in 2019. E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes. Due to their prevalence, understanding the fundamental architecture of these platforms will benefit any full-stack web developer.

This assignment was to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. I started by first configuring a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

Because this application wonâ€™t be deployed, I've provided a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the acceptance criteria being met.
